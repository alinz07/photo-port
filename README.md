## **What Problem does this solve and how was a solution accomplished?**

A portfolio with React helps set you apart from other developers who shy away from the latest technologies. A Single Page Application build with React is a great place for me to share my projects with propspective employers and fellow developers, with whom I can collaborate on current/future projects.

<br/>

## **Things I learned**

-   How to conditionally render a component and manage state between the parent and child components.
-   Use hooks to toggle a modal.
-   How to deploy applications to Github Pages.

<br/>

## **What makes this project stand out?**

-   The content rendering and use of state variables make this app impressive to me. I really like simple file structure and minimal code to dynamically render content.

<br/>

## **Challenge Criteria**

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer<br/>

-   Build a single-page application with React<br/>

-   Create reusable components within a React application<br/>

-   Manage state within React components<br/>

-   Pass props to child components<br/>

-   Use React Hooks to manage state in functional components<br/>

-   Conditionally render components based on updates to state<br/>
